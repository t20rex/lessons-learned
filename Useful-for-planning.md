My key takeaway would be importance of specifying a desired software feature through user stories. 
Advantage of user stories is that they can be used readily in project planning, and they are written so that each can be given an estimate of how difficult or time–consuming it will be to develop.

**[Be Precise]**

Because stories exhibit some of the same characteristics of use cases or traditional requirements statements, it’s important to look at what distinguishes stories from these earlier requirements techniques. These differences can lead to many advantages for user stories.
However, as development team may create hundreds of user stories during a project, user story should be concise and address a feature that can programmed in couple days at most. User stories emphasize verbal communication. Written language is often very imprecise, and there’s no guarantee that a developer will interpret a statement in the same way, especially when

**[Three C’s]**

For each of these short units, the development team should use the "Three C's." 

These are:
	Card
	Conversation
	Confirmation

**What are the top mistakes that people make?** 

+Stories are intentionally vague before iteration planning.  If you skip the acceptance criteria conversation, you risk moving in the wrong direction, missing edge cases or overlooking customer needs
To come up with a better user story, it must be noted that employers need to stimuplate high level conversations with developers regarding a particular user story before the work on that unit begins and writes the code. 
These conversations will establish the specific type of work that needs to be done.
